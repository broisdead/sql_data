📦 Step 1: Dataset Setup
We created three core tables for an Ecommerce scenario:

2. products
Stores product details like name and price.

3. orders
Tracks customer orders with order value and date.

🔄 Step 2: Data Insertion
We inserted a few rows into each table to simulate real-world Ecommerce data.

🔍 Step 3: SQL Operations
✅ a. SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY


🔗 b. JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

📌 c. Subqueries
Used subqueries to get customers with max orders, or total orders by specific criteria.
